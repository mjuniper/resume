# resume

This used to be where my resume lived. It was a bespoke json file that I used to generate an html file with mustache templates. It was pretty old, using jquery and bootstrap. And the toolchain was grunt.

Then I discovered that the idea of a json resume had become [standardized](https://jsonresume.org/). So I moved this over to the repo for my main [site](https://github.com/mjuniper/mikejuniper), migrated to jsonresume, and updated the content slightly.

The bottom line is that this now just redirects to mikejuniper.com.
