# resume

This used to be where my resume lived. It was a bespoke json file that I used to generate an html file with mustache templates. It was pretty old, using jquery and bootstrap. And the toolchain was grunt. I felt that it, and also my main website at mikejuniper.com (which was also quite old), reflected poorly on me. But I wanted to have something up at mikejuniper.com.

Then I discovered that the idea of a json resume had become [standardized](https://jsonresume.org/).

So I moved my resume over to the repo for my main [site](https://github.com/mjuniper/mikejuniper), migrated to jsonresume, and updated the content slightly.

The bottom line is that this now just redirects to mikejuniper.com.
